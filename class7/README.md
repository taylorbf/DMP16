### Lab

Try to solve these on your own. However, if you feel stuck, you can discuss it with a classmate.

##### 1. Counter

Create a sketch that counts upward when you click the sketch. Use console.log() or text() to display the number as it counts upward.


##### 2. Loops

Use a `for` loop to draw 10 circles in a row, evenly spaced.


##### 3. Probability

Create a sketch that loads a red background 50% of the time, and loads a blue background 50% of the time.

When you are done, please notify me so that I can view your solutions. Then, move on to working on your generative art project.
