# Objects

### Creating JS Objects

Creating **JavaScript Objects** is a fun and useful technique which lets you create many similar but independent entities.

In class, we looked at creating a bouncing ball. To do so, we had to create several variables -- x, y, directionX, directionY -- and draw a circle on to the page.

What if you wanted to create many independent bouncing balls?

You can do so by creating an object template for your bouncing ball, and then create many copies ("instances") from that template.

If you are interested in exploring this path for your final project, you should consult the following resources.

**HANDOUT**

I created a [handout](https://github.com/taylorbf/DMP16/tree/master/z-extras/OOP) and a few demo sketches which detail creating a 'raindrop' object and multiplying it to create a simulation of rain.

**HEADS UP: Be sure you feel comfortable with the basic uses of variables, loops, and arrays before starting this unit!**
