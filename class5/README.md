## Randomness

"When we use chance operations, we give up the idea of limiting things to the best. We take everything." - John Cage

"The ego has the capacity to cut itself off from the rest of the mind or to flow with it, and it does that by developing likes and dislikes, tastes and memory. My discipline was that of chance, shifting my responsibility from making choices to asking questions and getting the answers by means of the ancient coin tossing method of the I Ching." - John Cage

In early 1951 John Cage discovered the I Ching, a Chinese classic text which describes how to identify order in chance events. It is used for divination. Cage asked questions of the I Ching as a tool for composing music that was free of his own free will.

Cage first tossed yarrow sticks and coins to produce random results. Later he received a large set of random numbers printed from a computer by friends at Bell Labs. When he ran out of these numbers, he obtained 1 million new numbers from the same venerable institution--with the caveat that this was the last time they would be able to provide the service.

Over the years, Cage's use of chance operations has come under criticism, as diminishing to the composition process, as a removal of the authority of the composer. James Pritchett rebuts this idea. He notes how Cage sometimes submitted multiple sets of questions to the I Ching, and only retained certain results for his compositions.

With more studies of Cage's work, it has become clear that composing by chance operations doesn't necessarily imply that the outcome is chaotic. The composer retained control over what parameters of music the random operations controlled, and therefore expressed a compositional voice through the creation of those random system.

[Pollock's expressionist technique also allowed for randomness, albeit to diffrent ends.](http://www.constantcircles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Pollock-number31.jpg)

## Reflection

Where do you see iteration in nature?

Where do you see randomness in nature?

## Assignment

##### Generative Art Assignment (see description in syllabus). 

Create a generative artwork in p5. This sketch should be designed so that the computer procedurally draws a unique artwork each time the sketch is loaded, without any further interaction. You may want to think of your sketch as a mechanical paintbrush. What rules do you want it to follow?

This project is due on the last day of residency, at the beginning of class. Post it online and be prepared to share your code with the class.
