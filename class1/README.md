# Intro to p5.js and 2d primitives 

This residency, you will work with [p5.js](http://p5js.org), a JavaScript toolkit for coding digital art, based on the [Processing](http://processing.org) programming environment. 

p5.js is remarkable because it runs *right in your web browser*. Through p5, you will learn the conventions of JavaScript, one of the core languages of the web and one of the most common languages used by developers today.


## Context: Creative Code

[*Artist and Computer* (1975)](http://www.atariarchives.org/artist/) lays out a vision for a "scientific aesthetic" in which hybrid artist-engineers explore computer programming as an expressive medium.

[Design by Numbers](https://vimeo.com/72611093), created by John Maeda in the late 1990s, was one of the first programming languages designed specifically for artists. Through Maeda's research group at MIT, Design By Numbers evolved into Processing, the inspiration for p5.js.

[*Process 4* by Casey Reas](http://thecreatorsproject-images.vice.com/videos/images/000/000/164/caseyreas_original.jpg?1xw:0.48xh;*,*&resize=1200:*) is an artwork generated by a computer algorithm. It's clear, however, that the human hands guiding the algorithm play a significant role in the work. The artist has broad control over the artwork, enough--it seems to me--to qualify this program as a personal expression. (We'll recreate this artwork in class towards the end of the residency.)

In [this performance](http://medias.ircam.fr/x6b4e2d), Kyle Stetz performs music by live coding JavaScript on stage. In music, often considered an art of emotion, performances like this seem to be the final obliteration of the notion that computer programming is a cold, objective or purely scientific act.

For a broader introduction, I encourage you to look through *Creative Code* by John Maeda, which I will leave on the bookshelves in the Soper Room after class on Day 2 and leave there for the remainder of the residency.


## Getting Started

###### See McCarthy, Ch 2

Our reference book will walk you through getting up and running with p5.js and the p5.js Editor (or another code editor).






## 2D Coordinate Plane

In p5, the drawing canvas is a 2D coordinate plane. This lets you draw and animate shapes with single-pixel accuracy.

The top left point of the canvas is (0,0). 

Distance is measured in pixels on an **x-axis** (moving to the right) and **y-axis** (moving down).

Shapes are drawn using (x,y) coordinates.


## Shapes, Colors, Fill, and Stroke

###### See McCarthy, Ch 3


## Interaction Preview: mouseX and mouseY

While a static (unmoving) shape can be drawn by manually entering coordinates...

```
function draw() {
	ellipse(50,50,25,25)
}
```

... a shape can become interactive by using your mouse coordinates as a control variable.

This sketch will cause the circle to follow your mouse:

```
function draw() {
	ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,25,25)
}
```

This sketch, using mouseX and mouseY in place of the *width* and *height* of the circle, will cause the circle to resize depending on your mouse motion

```
function draw() {
	ellipse(0,0,mouseX,mouseY)
}
```



## Debugging JavaScript

###### See McCarthy, Ch 2, p. 13


## Putting your sketch on the web with GitHub Pages

GitHub has some perks. One is that it can host our p5 sketches on the web!

* In the GitHub App, open your personal repository for this class.
* On the top bar, find the branch icon: 

   ![github branch icon](images/git-branch-512.png)

* Create a new branch that is called `gh-pages`. It **must** be called `gh-pages`, no other name will do.
* Click Publish in the top righthand corner of the app
* GitHub will automatically turn your `gh-pages` branch into a hosted website.
* Your sketch is now online at: `http://yourusername.github.io/reponame/foldername/`
* In class we will walk through replacing each of the parts of that URL with your specific username, repo name, and sketch path.
